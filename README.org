* Sort Test

A command line utility to run a variety of sorting algorithms with a
variety of options.

To compile:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :results silent
gcc sorttest.c -o sorttest
#+END_SRC

Now we can do a test run. Let's run selection sort on a random array
of 20 values ranging from 0 to 50 five times.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :results silent
./sorttest selection 20 50 5
#+END_SRC

We already know that selection sort is slower than mergesort for large
arrays. You can verify this empirically if you want to.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :results silent
time ./sorttest selection 2000 100 5
time ./sorttest merge 2000 100 5
#+END_SRC

Algorithms supported: 

- bubble
- counting
- insertion
- merge
- quick
- radix
- selection


** Todos [2/4]
*** DONE add initial support for choosing algo, num values, and range
*** DONE support for repetitions (right now the reps arg doesn't matter)
*** TODO support for verification of sorting (as an additional arg)
*** TODO  cleanup the mess
