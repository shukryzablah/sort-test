* Sort Test (Performance Evaluation Project 1)
** Sample Use
We provide a command line utility to run a variety of sorting
algorithms with a variety of options.

To compile we use the following command: 

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :results silent :exports both
gcc sorttest.c -o sorttest -lrt
#+END_SRC

Note that we need to link the =librt.a= library when we compile a
program that uses the ~clock_gettime~ function. 

Suppose we want to time the =merge_sort= algorithm on an array of 1000
random values for values under ten thousand, and we want to repeat this 10 times. 

We can run the compiled executable in the command line as follows: 

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :results output :exports both
./sorttest merge 1000 10000 10 TRUE
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
merge,1000,10000,10,185112
merge,1000,10000,10,135085
merge,1000,10000,10,133641
merge,1000,10000,10,133323
merge,1000,10000,10,133160
merge,1000,10000,10,133778
merge,1000,10000,10,132964
merge,1000,10000,10,133414
merge,1000,10000,10,133394
merge,1000,10000,10,133393
Correctly Sorted: 10/10
#+end_example

The program prints the algorithm, the length of the input, the range
of the values, the number of repetitions, and the elapsed time in
nanoseconds in that order. The output is in a csv format.

We used the option TRUE in our command in order to run a function that
verifies the array is sorted. Normally you would use the FALSE option
to omit this step.

In order to automate our data collection we create a small bash script
called =driver.sh= that contains the commands we will run. (Remember
to use ~chmod +x <file>~ to be able to execute scripts). 

In order to create a csv file that contains all of our collected data
we redirect the output of the program into the =test.csv= file.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :results silent :export both
./driver.sh > test.csv
#+END_SRC 

After collecting our data we use an R script in order to generate a
plot of the elapsed times. Again, we allow the script to be executable
for convenience.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :results silent :export both
./analyze.R
#+END_SRC

Now we can check the current directory in order to retrive the image of our plot.

Remember that we can change:
- the sorttest.c file to change the behavior of the timing programs
  and the way data is created
- the driver.sh file to specify sorttest input to decide what data to collect
- the analyze.R to create different plots and manipulate data

** Supported Algorithms
- bubble
- counting 
- insertion
- merge
- quick
- radix
- selection
** Todos [6/8]
- [X] add initial support for choosing algo, num values, and range
- [X] support for repetitions (right now the reps arg doesn't matter)
- [X] support for verification of sorting (as an additional arg)
- [X] use high precision methods (clock_gettime)
- [X] update readme for sample workflow with bash and R
- [X] fix counting sort not working
- [ ] add more clever timing scheme
- [ ] brainstorm possible timing setups
