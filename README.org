* Sort Test

A command line utility to run a variety of sorting algorithms with a
variety of options.

To compile:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :results silent
gcc sorttest.c -o sorttest
#+END_SRC

Now we can do a test run. Let's run selection sort on a random array
of 20 values ranging from 0 to 50 once.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :results silent
./sorttest selection 20 50 1
#+END_SRC

Go ahead and try using the time command to get a rough estimate about
how much slower selection sort is than merge sort for an array of
20000 values.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :results silent
time ./sorttest selection 20000 100 1
time ./sorttest merge 20000 100 1 
#+END_SRC

** Todos:
- [ ] support for repetitions (right now the reps arg doesn't matter)
- [ ] support for verification of sorting (as an additional arg)
- [ ] cleanup the mess
